# cephalopod
cephalopod is intended to be the minimal useful cross-platform "2D game framework" above the level of hardware abstaction layers
like SDL but below the level of game engines. Basically, it's akin to cocos2d-x with all the crap cut out and using modern C++.

This is a total work in progress. It is for now statically linked to SFML, with the SFML dependency fully hidden so I may swap it out.
If anyone is interested email me at the address found on http://jwezorek.com.
